So, my partner and I created a system designed for hearing-impaired students in dorms. It acts as a door-bell system that provides real-time visual LED alerts when motion is detected outside a door. The system consists of two units: a Sensor Unit with a PIR motion sensor that detects activity and transmits data via UART, and an Alert Unit that instantly triggers an LED visual cue to notify the user. This technical component itself is simple, but it served as a great introductory project to working with STM32 boards"
